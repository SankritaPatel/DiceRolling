# Dice Simulator

This is a Python script that simulates rolling a six-sided dice. It generates a random number between 1 and 6 and displays the corresponding face of a dice using ASCII art.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:
    ```
    python dice_simulator.py
    ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions. Press 'Enter' to roll the dice, and 'y' followed by 'Enter' to roll again, or any other key followed by 'Enter' to exit the program.
